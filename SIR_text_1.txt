The SIR model is the most famous, and a very simplified model for the spread of a contagious desease. The model takes its name from the three "compartments" it uses to separate the members of a fixed-size population. Its variables are the sizes of these subgroups:

$S(t)$ = number of **susceptibe** individuals;

$I(t)$ = number of **infected** individuals;

$R(t)$ = number of **recovered** individuals.

The model is based on very simple assumptions:

1) The rate at which susceptibe individuals get infected is proportional to both the number of susceptible individuals, $S(t)$, and the number of infected individual, $I(t)$. The speed of the processes is determined by an empirical parameter $c$, called **contact (or transmission) rate**.

2) The rate at which infected individuals recover is simply proportional to this number $I(t)$. The speed of the processes is determined by a second empirical parameter, the **recovery rate** $r$.

The process can be described by the following diagram:
